not necessarily illustrative; for example, this paragraph is not
really an abstract, because it contains information not found
elsewhere in the document.  The \LaTeXe\ source file
(\texttt{skel.tex}) contains some non-printing comments giving

\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Background}
\justify
There has been a growing demand for the development of wireless systems, to meet the increasing demands of consumers. In order to meet this demand researchers have looked to software defined radio's (SDR); this interest in SDR is due to the ease and simplicity for the development and implementation in various applications. This rise in interest has led to a large spike in development of SDR, which is resulting in a broadened application for SDR. \cite{ref1} \\
SDR's are being applied in a variety of different scenarios, but this thesis focuses primarily on the development of a switching system to complement the research done using SDR as a tool for medical imaging. The use of SDR in microwave imaging has provided an alternative diagnostic tool that presents significant benefits of current technology, primarily because of its low cost, portability, non-invasiveness and uses non-ionization radiation. This allows the system to be compact and suitable for medical application in the field. \cite{ref2} \cite{ref3} \\
As the demand for faster wireless systems increases, so does the interest in researching the application of using multiple antenna wireless links for digital communication; using multiple antennas introduces a greater range of possibilities by increasing the speed of the networks traffic \cite{ref4}. To accommodate for the control of multiple radio frequency (RF) front ends the communication system will require a RF switching system; there are two primary categories for RF and microwave switches, electromechanical relay (EMR) and solid-state relay (SSR). \\
There are advantages and disadvantages in use either, SSR's are available in smaller packages and have a higher switching speed but are restricted to single pole, EMR's have a lower isolation loss but are have slower speed due to their physical construction. SSR don't have a wearable switching mechanism while EMR do, making them impractical in scenarios which require large amounts of switching \cite{ref5}. Therefore, this thesis will primarily focus on utilising SSR's as opposed to EMR's, to meet the high speed requirements while maintaining a low cost and compact design. \\
This thesis project looks into the development of an RF switching system to allow an RF front end to be connected to a large number of antennas or sensors, by developing a RF switch matrix that provides a high speed switching on multiple antennas. The results obtained from this will facilitate and support the expansion in the current development of biomedical RF imaging systems as well as future projects.

\chapter{Theory}
\section{Software Defined Radio}
The application of the RF switching system this thesis looks a developing, is to provide an RF front end such as a software defined radio (SDR) or Vector Network Analyser (VNA) with the ability to communicate multiple antennas or sensors. An SDR is a radio that is partially or entirely controlled by software in the physical layer in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. The OSI model is used to describe the subsystems of a communication system, where the physical layer represents the data. This allows for the software or firmware to be adjusted resulting in the change the carrier frequency, data rate, modulation, coding, etc. without having the reconstruct the hardware of the radio [6]. This project doesn't look into the control of an SDR, instead focuses on interfacing the switching system with the SDR. It is expected that the SDR will have an impedance of $50\ohm$ which is common of most SDR technology or a less common impedance of $75\ohm$ [7].

\section{Microwave Theory}
To design and develop microwave circuits a fundamental understanding of how microwaves operate and ... in ... is required

\subsection{Transmission Line Theory}
A transmission line is a medium that transfers electromagnetic energy along its path, an example can be seen in \fig{fig:tline}. Transmission lines will form the primary basis of this thesis since it will be primary medium for the signal travelling through the RF switching system. It is crucial to ensure that the transmission line matches the source and antenna; otherwise it can cause the power to be reflected back. \newline
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{tline.png}
	\caption{Transmission line Thevenin equivalent of antenna and transmitter}
	\label{fig:tline}
\end{figure} 
To prevent this reflection, the impedances at each end must be matched to the transmission lines characteristic impedance. This can be done through L-section matching, stepped transmission lines or filters.  \\[0.1cm]
L-section is a method used for matching transmission lines; this involves using a capacitor and inductor in a series and parallel combination to match the load. Stepped transmission lines provides impedance matching for lumped elements. Finally, filters can also be used for impedance matching; they are typically used to provide an adjustable match for the circuit over different frequencies. By inserting a filter that is a perfect match for the transmission line at a known frequency [9]. This theory will be considered when evaluating the design for the development boards and if required the PCB so they are perfectly matched to reduce any unnecessary losses in the system.

\subsection{Scattering Parameters}
Scattering parameters (S-Parameters) are a matrix that describes the behaviour of linear electrical networks; this matrix is used over a broad range of disciplines of electrical engineering but is particularly useful in microwave engineering.
Since the RF switching system this thesis is designing will not generating its own signal or provide any RF front end's; even though the system is switching, it will always have a single input and single output. Therefore, this design can be simplified to be a 2-port network, as shown in Figure 2.\\[0.1cm]
%figure
2-port networks are most commonly used and can easily be adapted to systems that are more complex, Figure 2 shows a simple diagram of a 2-port network and Equation 1 shows the matrix and equations given for the network [9].

\subsection{System Losses}










\section{RF Switches}
This thesis topic looks into the development of a RF switching system, this will be done by utilising RF and microwave switches to create an RF switching matrix. An RF switch matrix are used to route RF signals from an input to an output.
There are several different types of switching matrix's, there is multiple input multiple output (MIMO), multiple input single output (MISO), single input multiple output (SIMO) and single input single output (SISO) [12]. For this project we are looking at controlling multiple outputs with a single input, so will be implementing a SIMO RF switching matrix.


\subsection{Switch Topologies}
When constructing a RF switch there are two typical topologies, these are multiplexers and general purpose relays; examples can be seen in Figure 3. General purpose relays are commonly a SPDT or SDnT relay's that are used for routing a signal between multiple paths. Multiplexers are devices that route a single input to multiple outputs or vice versa, they are commonly built from multiple SPDT relays but have a greater inherited insertion loss from this configuration [13]. 
%IMAGE
Looking at Figure 3 (b) it can be assumed that there will be losses through each path it takes, insertion loses through first switch, first cable/track, second switch, etc. Therefore, it is ideal to develop a topology as close to Figure 3 (a) to ensure there is little loss through multiple cascaded switches and cable/tracks. This thesis will be looking into designing a 1x12 SIMO multiplexer, similar to the design in Figure 3 (b) to provide the available ports as well as a consistent loss through the system.




\section{Substrate Selection}
%talk about different available substrates, pros/cons ->how they effect high freq. ->cost
%discuss which are most suitable for this project. MAKE disciosion
There are various substrates that are available for developing the RF switching matrix. Four key substrates were looked at these include:
\begin{itemize} [noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
  \item FR-4
  \item Epoxy
\end{itemize}
Table \ref{tab:substrate} contains the characteristics of these four substrates that are utilised to calculate the dimensions of the RF tracks. 
When designing PCB's for 




\section{RF Track Design}
%talk about; microstrip, stripline, coplanar. design techniques, 
For designing the RF tracks on the PCB there are three primary options available
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0.5pt]
	\item Micro-strip
	\item Coplanar Wave-guide, and
	\item Strip-line
\end{itemize}
RF tracks provide ...\\
For designing the tracks we need to consider:
\begin{align}
\lambda&= \frac{c}{f\sqrt{\epsilon_{eff}}} \label{eq:lam} \\
\theta &= \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \label{eq:phase}
\end{align}
We need to consider the Figure \ref{eq:lam} and \ref{eq:phase} as these are the fundamentals for designing any type of track. To determine which track is best suited this thesis will look at each available option.\newline
%------
These equations are used for the approximate design of RF tracks, in order to obtain a more precise design which consider a wider range of variables dedicated software is  used to further verify the design of the tracks.

\subsection{Micro-strip}
Microstrip RF tracks are the most common RF transmission line currently used in practice. %NEED TO CITE THIS!!!!
%---------------------
% need to talk about microstrip in general
%----------------------
\fig{fig:microdiag} presents a typical microstrip which has been labelled the critical dimensions of this transmission line. \newline
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{microdiag.jpg}
	\caption{Microstrip diagram}
	\label{fig:microdiag}
\end{figure} 
We are able to calculate the dimensions shown in \fig{fig:microdiag} by using the following:
\begin{align}
W&=\frac{t}{\pi} \left[ ln \left( \frac{2h}{t} \right) +1 \right] \\
H&=h-2t 
\end{align}
\begin{numcases}{\epsilon_{eff}=}
	\frac{\epsilon_r+1}{2} + \frac{\epsilon-1}{2} \left[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{12H}{W}}} +0.04 \left(1- \frac{W}{H} \right)^2 \right] &$when \left( \frac{W}{H} \right) < 1$  \label{eq:epsh<1} \\
	\frac{\epsilon+1}{2}+ \frac{\epsilon-1}{2\sqrt{1+\frac{12H}{W}}} & $when \left( \frac{W}{H} \right) > 1$  \label{eq:epsh>1}
\end{numcases}
\begin{numcases}{Z_0=}
   \frac{60}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{eff}}} \cdot ln\left( \frac{8H}{W}+\frac{W}{4H} \right), & $when \left( \frac{W}{H} \right) < 1$  \label{eq:microh<1} \\
   \frac{120 \pi}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{eff}} \cdot \left[ \frac{W}{H}+1.393+\frac{2}{3}ln \left(\frac{W}{H}+1.444 \right) \right]}, & $when \left( \frac{W}{H} \right) > 1$ \label{eq:microh>1}
\end{numcases}
In order to calculate the dimensions of the micro-strip track we are required to make key decisions for the design. By selecting the frequency range, impedance, phase shift substrate and track thickness we are able to determine the dimensions for the track. \newline
We are able to determine the width ($W$) and length($X$) of the track by selecting a substrate determining the dielectric constant ($\epsilon_{eff}$), copper thickness ($t$) and height($H$). We can set the

The three available evaluation boards we investigated using a MODELNUMBER VNA; each switch was wired so that the input is connected to the output, while all other ports were $50\ohm$ terminated. The switch was powered and the controls set to allow the signal to proprigate down the open path, then changed the state to have a closed path; this was conducted for each evaluation board. The results were exported to a \textit{.s2p} file to be analysed using ADS, and the results can be seen in Figure's \ref{fig:res:}, \ref{fig:res:} \& \ref{fig:res:}.

\chapter{Companion disk}

If you wish to make some computer files available to your examiners,
you can list and describe the files here.  The files can be supplied
on a disk and inserted in a pocket fixed to the inside back cover.

The disk will not be needed if you can specify a URL from which the
files can be downloaded.
