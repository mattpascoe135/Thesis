   abstract = {  In many applications, one has the choice between solid-state relays (SSR) and electrochemical relays (EMR). Advances in semiconductor technology have spawned SSRs that offer clear advantages over EMRs. However, do not discount EMRs - the technology and performance of these devices are also steadily evolving
as a result, EMRs are often the switching elements of choice. An overview of the relative merits and demerits of the 2 types, along with a sampling of recent products, may provide some insights into the selection process. SSRs need protective measures in spiky environments. A multipole EMR can often beat multiple SSRs in volumetric efficiency. Carefully check EMR specs for life expectancy at full load. Use an EMR for the lowest off-state leakage current
use an SSR for high I/O isolation.},

   abstract = {We present a new, efficient strategy for designing fully balanced transmission line RF circuits for solid state NMR probes based on back propagation of common impedance nodes (BPCIN). In this approach, the impedance node phenomenon is the sole means of achieving mutual RF isolation and balance in all RF channels. BPCIN is illustrated using a custom double resonance 3.2 mm MAS probe operating at 500 MHz ((1)H) and 125 MHz ((13)C). When fully optimized, the probe is capable of producing high homogeneity (810°/90° ratios of 86% and 89% for (1)H and (13)C, respectively) and high efficiency (γB1=100 kHz for (1)H and (13)C at 70 W and 180 W of RF input, respectively
up to 360 kHz for (1)H). The probe's performance is illustrated by 2D MAS correlation spectra of microcrystals of the tripeptide N-f-MLF-OH and hydrated amyloid fibrils of the protein PI3-SH3.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the replica interference problem of a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) receiver with a beam switching antenna (BSA) within the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) framework. Our frequency-domain analysis has revealed the following important findings: (i) without co-existing system, replica interference in the system can be completely avoided as long as the beam pattern switching rate of the BSA receiver is an integer multiple of the product of the OFDM sampling rate and the number of receiving beam patterns and (ii) with co-existing systems, replica interference cannot always be avoided because co-existing systems may induce replicas in the operating frequency bands of the system. We present a replica interference criterion that depends on the co-existing status and users’ beam switching capabilities. Based on our findings, we propose various replica interference avoidance (RINA) strategies for different co-existing and cooperating network scenarios. In addition, the overall network operation principles of the proposed RINA strategy are presented. Simulation results verify that the proposed MIMO-OFDM system with a BSA successfully provides both MIMO and OFDM benefits, thereby resolving replica interference issues.},

The system is based on a novel hemispherical real-aperture antenna array, which is employed in a multi-static radar-based detection system. The array consists of 16 UWB aperture-coupled stacked-patch antennas located on a section of a hemisphere. The radar system is designed to be used with realistic three-dimensional (3D) breast phantoms, which have been developed, as well as with real breast cancer patients during initial clinical trials. Images are formed using two different beamforming algorithms and the performance of these algorithms is firstly compared through numerical simulation. Experimental results for the same beamforming techniques are then presented, demonstrating the successful detection of 4 and 6 mm diameter spherical tumors in the curved breast phantom.},

   abstract = {A wideband microwave system for head imaging is presented. The system includes an array of 16 corrugated tapered slot antennas that are installed on an adjustable platform. A switching device is used to enable the antennas to sequentially send a wideband 1-4 GHz microwave signal and capture the backscattered signals. Those signals are recorded using suitably designed virtual instrument software architecture. To test the capability of the system to detect brain injuries, a low-cost mixture of materials that emulate the frequency-dispersive electrical properties of the major brain tissues across the frequency band 1-4 GHz are used to construct a realistic-shape head phantom. A target that emulates a realistic hemorrhage stroke is fabricated and inserted in two different locations inside the fabricated head phantom. A preprocessing algorithm that utilizes the symmetry of the two halves of human head is used to extract the target response from the background reflections. A post-processing confocal algorithm is used to get an image of the phantom and to accurately detect the presence and location of the stroke.},
